Project Overview:

Goal: To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting car prices based on various features.

Motivation: Accurate price prediction is valuable for buyers, sellers, dealerships, and insurance companies in the automotive industry.

Methodology: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression) trained on historical car data.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the raw data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features
.
Feature Engineering: Creating new, informative features from existing ones to improve model performance (e.g., calculating car age from manufacturing year).

Model Training: Training a chosen machine learning model on the prepared dataset.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.

Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional): Optimizing model parameters for better performance using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

Model Deployment (Optional): Integrating the trained model into a web application (e.g., using Flask or Streamlit) for real-time predictions.
